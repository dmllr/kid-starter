# Brief
Call family and launch only allowed applications. Comfortable to the child.

# Features
<p>This great, simple and free application replaces the launcher of the phone when it holds by a child.</p>

<p>● The kid has its own phone?</p>
<p>Then KidStarter - what you need. Install it as a default launcher and limit your kid to calls only to allowed contacts and run only approved applications.</p>

<p>● Need to give your phone to child?</p>
</p>KidStarter helps again. Set it as the default launcher, set up allowed applications, and when the phone will come back to you, simply and conveniently return your preferred launcher. The child does not get to your screens, contacts and applications and will not be able to bring there own order.</p>

<p>Easy and simple application interface is designed specifically for children. Large icons, large pictures, be able to read is not necessary.</p>
